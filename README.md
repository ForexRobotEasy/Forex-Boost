### Development Name: Forex Robot Easy Team

This README file provides an overview of the code for the Forex Boost Expert Advisor. It explains how the code works and describes the functionality of the Expert Advisor. Please note that ForexRobotEasy is not the official developer of this product. We are only providing a sample code that can work as described in this product. To find the official developer of this product, please use MQL5.

### Code Description

The Forex Boost Expert Advisor is designed to trade in the forex market based on certain conditions and filters. The code includes necessary libraries and functions for trading and indicator calculations.

#### Input Parameters

The Expert Advisor allows the user to define input parameters to customize the trading strategy. The following input parameters are available:

- volatilityPeriod: The period for calculating volatility.
- volatilityThreshold: The threshold for high volatility.
- enableWaveAnalysis: Enable or disable the wave analysis filter.
- enableSupportResistance: Enable or disable the support and resistance filter.

#### Global Variables

The code defines two global variables:

- trade: An instance of the CTrade class used for trading operations.
- indicators: An instance of the CIndicator class used for indicator calculations.

#### Initialization

The OnInit() function is called when the Expert Advisor is initialized. It initializes the trade and indicator classes, sets the expert name, and returns INIT_SUCCEEDED if initialization is successful.

#### Trading Logic

The OnTick() function is called on every tick and contains the main trading logic. It calculates the volatility using the iATR() function and checks if the volatility is above the defined threshold. If the volatility is high, it applies additional filters (wave analysis and support/resistance) to determine the trading signal.

If the signal passes the filters and is a buy signal, the Expert Advisor places a buy order using the trade.Buy() function. If the signal is a sell signal, the Expert Advisor places a sell order using the trade.Sell() function.

#### Additional Filters

The code includes two functions, WaveAnalysisFilter() and SupportResistanceFilter(), to implement the wave analysis and support/resistance filters, respectively. These functions should be implemented by the user to define the specific logic for these filters. They should return true if the signal passes the filter and false otherwise.

#### Signal Determination

The code includes two functions, SignalIsBuy() and SignalIsSell(), to determine if the trading signal is a buy or sell signal, respectively. The user should implement the specific logic for these functions based on their trading strategy. They should return true if the signal is a buy/sell signal and false otherwise.

### Product Description

Forex Boost is a powerful Expert Advisor designed to provide accurate trading predictions in the forex market. Developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team, this Expert Advisor incorporates advanced filtering techniques to identify high volatility market conditions and generate profitable trading signals.

The Expert Advisor utilizes the concept of volatility to determine when to enter trades. By calculating the average true range (ATR) over a specified period, Forex Boost identifies periods of high volatility. It then applies additional filters, such as wave analysis and support/resistance analysis, to confirm the trading signals.

Forex Boost offers flexibility to the user with customizable input parameters. Traders can adjust the volatility period, volatility threshold, and enable/disable the wave analysis and support/resistance filters to suit their trading preferences.

To ensure reliable and accurate trading predictions, Forex Boost is backed by rigorous testing and optimization. The Expert Advisor has been thoroughly reviewed and its trading results can be found on the developer's website [forexroboteasy.com](https://forexroboteasy.com/forex-robot-review/forex-boost-review-scalping-tool-for-accurate-trading-predictions/).
